Group members
=============

## About

This is a WordPress plugin that can expose a list of WordPress users through a shortcode.

It relies on [Role Scoper](http://wordpress.org/plugins/role-scoper/) for categorization of users into groups, so you need to install that first.

## Usage

You can render the members of a particular group by adding this to your page or post:

[group-members group="visitors"]
